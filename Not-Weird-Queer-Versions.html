                <h3>Version 0.0.008</h3>
                <p>Version <a href="twine/Not-Weird-Queer-0-0-008.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.0.008</a> is a quality of life update that includes less dummy text and skeleton pages than previous versions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Now running in Harlowe 3.2.3, which means some syntax and functionality has been changed. If you run into any broken links, please leave some feedback.</li>
                    <li>Removed some references to the terms "female" or "male" in the game text and replaced them with more contextually appropriate terms.</li>
                    <li>Filled in more dummy text.</li>
                    <li>Removed name highlighting to speed up page load times.</li>
                    <li>v. 0.0.007  bug fixes:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed the issue where when choosing a name, the Harlowe engine would occasionally display an error message by replacing the prompt with a text box.</li>
                        <li>Fixed the issue where inputting a name that is already the ally's name or your deadname would cause the Harlowe engine to run into an error.</li>
                        <li>Fixed a few more instances where the name "Ryan" was still hard-coded into the text instead of dynamically showing the name of ally for the current play-through.</li>
                        <li>Fixed many issues encountered in the female route.</li>
                        <li>The debug page now functions the way it was inteded to.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Version 0.0.007</h3>
                <p>Version <a href="twine/Not-Weird-Queer-0-0-007.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.0.007</a> includes a brand-new day 1 that acts as a sort of prologue. The new day 1 is still largely incomplete.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Known issue</strong>: when choosing a name, the Harlowe engine will occasionally display an error message. If you click "OK" on the message, the game will resume normally.</li>
                    <li>Contains a new day 1 that serves as an introduction to the player character's psyche and world, providing context on their mental state. This new day 1 is heavily comprised of dummy text, as is much of part 2.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the game, Harlowe will export a summary of the player's choices to the developer.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The system for exporting the passage history is buggy and detects an infinite loop when there isn't one. I am investigating a workaround.</li>
                        <li>Learn more about what is collected and how it is used <a href="privacy.html">here</a>.</li>

                        <li>Fixed the bug where the player is awarded with double points/penalty when they get bullied in history class on part 2 day 9 (absolute day).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Known bug</strong>: if you input a name that is already the ally's name or your deadname, the Harlowe engine will run into an error.</li>

                    <li>Loop logic now depends on $loop, a variable tracking the absolute day as written in the code. Each unique day has a unique $loop number, and $loop numbers repeat when days repeat.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you find any errors in the loop logic, such as skipping days, sequentially repeated days, or events appearing on the wrong days, please submit a <a href="https://forms.gle/mc2JKRCaoz9jvtki9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bug report</a>.</li>
